Game3011 Assignment 4 Hacking Minigame Design Document

Theme:
The theme of my hacking game is of a literal sense where you must answer the riddle and stop the
letters in the right order to spell out the answer. Drawing from inspiration from the Matrix,
I created this puzzler hacking game. I think it would fit well into any game that would require
a hacking game and change the answers to something appropriate to the game.

System:
The game is quite simple in design. The letters go through the entire alphabet and stop when you
hit the button below it. The goal is to figure out the word to the riddle and spell it out with
the given number of characters.

Difficulty:
There are 3 levels of difficulty and 2 different "modes". The difficulty is how challenging the
riddle/puzzle is. Then the added difficulty of modes being either figuring out the 4 letter word,
or a 5 letter word.

Skill:
It was hard to find the right balance of where skill should be involved. So this was defaulted to
be everytime you pass a puzzle you gain an extra chance/try to guess. If the game was more flush
I would like to add more words then maybe enable a hint or free letter skill mechanic however at
this stage that would make the game too easy.
